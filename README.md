# Unity-Essentials-Project

Unity version: 2022.3.60f1
 
This repository contains the project I completed as part of the Unity Essentials official course. The course provided a comprehensive introduction to Unity, covering the fundamental concepts and tools needed to create interactive 3D applications and games.

## Project Overview

The Unity Essentials project includes various scenes and scripts that demonstrate key Unity features such as:

- Scene management
- Game objects and components
- Physics and collisions
- Scripting with C#
- User interface (UI) elements
- Animation and audio

## Features

- **Interactive Scenes**: Multiple scenes showcasing different aspects of Unity.
- **Game Mechanics**: Basic game mechanics implemented using Unity's physics engine.
- **User Interface**: Simple UI elements for interaction and feedback.
- **Animations**: Basic animations to enhance the visual experience.
- **Audio**: Sound effects and background music to create an immersive environment.

## How to Play?

You can run WebGL build of the project by visiting the following link in your browser: [Unity Essentials Project](https://play.unity.com/en/games/aa99320f-e9e6-4fb9-a851-872d2b749884/essentials-project) \

**Note**: For some reason, in the WebGL build 3D Sounds doesn't work, so in the "Kithen Audio" scene you will hear the 2D sounds, so it will be a bit weird. This is problem of the Unity and WebGL, so I can't fix it on my side, spatial audio will not work in the web-version. \
You also can clone this repository and open the project in Unity Editor to explore the scenes and scripts, and maybe I will make a build with executibles for Windows and Linux in the release page of my GitHub repo.
